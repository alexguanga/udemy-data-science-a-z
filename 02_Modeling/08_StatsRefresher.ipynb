    "### Variables\n",
    "- Categorical\n",
    "     - Nominal: Remember Names and these are things that cannot be ordered\n",
    "     - Ordinal: Can be ranked/ordered (like Small, Medium, and Large)\n",
    "- Numeric\n",
    "    - Discrete: These are whole numbers (how many cars are outside?)\n",
    "    - Continous: These can be parts, like the amount of money you have to pay for a house (232.221)\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Regression\n",
    "- Linear\n",
    "    - Simple linear regression\n",
    "    - Multiple linear regression\n",
    "- Logistic\n",
    "    - Simple logistic regression\n",
    "    - Multiple logistic regression\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Ordinary Least Squares\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### R-Squared\n",
    "- Closer to 1 the better\n",
    "- Closer to 0 the worse\n",
    "- The SS total is the total difference from the actual observation and the average\n",
    "- The SS residual is the difference from the actual observation and the point in the linear regression\n",
    "- The closer the line is to the residual, the larger the R^2 meaning the line fits the observation better\n",
    "- Formula:  r^2 = 1 - (SS_Residual/SS_Total)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adjusted R-Squared\n",
    "- The R_squared is good untill we start more variables\n",
    "- When we add a new variable, we are looking for a way to better fit the observations without the ability to have any penalties\n",
    "- Thus, either R-Squared will it either decrease or stay the same with new variables\n",
    "- Adjusted R-Squared penalizes it because the more you variable you are adding to the model, the further you are from 1\n",
