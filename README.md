About:

If you a would like a solid foundation in data science, this course does the job. It provides a solid intuition but I believe Andrew Ng's course does a better job. Also, it does lack practicality. It does not use R nor Python.

Given that this is one of Kirill's older course, I would suggest his Machine Learning course if you like practicality on frequently used algorithms.
